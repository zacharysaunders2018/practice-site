Hawaiʻi, also called the Island of Hawaiʻi,[2] the Big Island or Hawaiʻi Island (/həˈwaɪ.i/ or /həˈwɑːiː/; Hawaiian:
[həˈwɐiʔi] or [həˈvɐiʔi]), which comprises Hawaiʻi County and the Hilo, HI Micropolitan Statistical Area, is an island,
county, and Micropolitan Statistical Area located in the U.S. state of Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands. It is the largest
and the southeastern-most of the Hawaiian islands, a chain of volcanic islands in the North Pacific Ocean. With an area
of 4,028 square miles (10,430 km2), it is larger than all of the other islands in the archipelago combined and is the
largest island in the United States. The island is often referred to as the "Big Island" to reduce confusion between the
island and the state. <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

The island of Maui (/ˈmaʊ.iː/; Hawaiian: [ˈmɐuwi])[2] is the second-largest of the Hawaiian Islands at 727.2 square
miles (1,883 km2) and is the 17th largest island in the United States.[3] Maui is part of the State of Hawaiʻi and is
the largest of Maui County's four islands, bigger than Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, and unpopulated Kahoʻolawe. In 2010, Maui had a
population of 144,444, third-highest of the Hawaiian Islands, behind that of Oʻahu and Hawaiʻi Island. Kahului is the
largest census-designated place (CDP) on the island with a population of 26,337 as of 2010 and is the commercial and
financial hub of the island.[4] Wailuku is the seat of Maui County and is the third-largest CDP as of 2010. Other
significant places include Kīhei (including Wailea and Makena in the Kihei Town CDP, which is the second-most-populated
CDP in Maui); Lahaina (including Kāʻanapali and Kapalua in the Lahaina Town CDP); Makawao; Pāʻia; Kula; Haʻikū; and
Hāna.

Oʻahu (pronounced [oˈʔɐhu]) or Oahu /oʊˈɑːhuː/, known as "The Gathering Place", is the third largest of the Hawaiian
Islands; however, it is the most populous of the islands in the U.S. state of Hawaii while also having the primary and
only intercontinental Honolulu International Airport. The state capital, Honolulu, is on Oʻahu's southeast coast.
Including small close-in offshore islands such as Ford Island and the islands in Kaneohe Bay and off the eastern
(windward) coast, it has a total land area of 596.7 square miles (1,545.4 km2), making it the 20th largest island in the
United States.[2] In the greatest dimension, this volcanic island is 44 miles (71 km) long and 30 miles (48 km) across.
The length of the shoreline is 227 miles (365 km). The island is the result of two separate shield volcanoes: Waiʻanae
and Koʻolau, with a broad "valley" or saddle (the central Oʻahu Plain) between them. The highest point is Mt. Ka'ala in
the Waiʻanae Range, rising to 4,003 feet (1,220 m) above sea level

Kauaʻi or Kauai[2] (/kə.ˈwaɪ.iː/; Hawaiian: [kɔuˈwɐʔi]) is geologically the oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands. With an
area of 562.3 square miles (1,456.4 km2), it is the fourth largest of the main islands in the Hawaiian archipelago, and
the 21st largest island in the United States.[3] Known also as the "Garden Isle", Kauaʻi lies 105 miles (169 km) across
the Kauaʻi Channel, northwest of Oʻahu. This island is the site of Waimea Canyon State Park.
The United States Census Bureau defines Kauaʻi as Census Tracts 401 through 409 of Kauaʻi County, Hawaiʻi, which is all
of the county except for the islands of Kaʻula, Lehua, and Niʻihau. The 2010 census population of Kauaʻi (the island)
was 67,091,[4] with the largest town by population being Kapaʻa.

    Molokaʻi or Molokai (/ˈmɒləkaɪ/; Hawaiian: [ˈmoloˈkɐʔi]) is an island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is 38 by 10
    miles (61 by 16 km) in size at its extreme length and width with a usable land area of 260 square miles (673.40
    km2), making it the fifth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island in the United States.[2]
    It lies east of Oʻahu across the 25-mile (40 km) wide Kaiwi Channel and north of Lānaʻi, separated from it by the
    Kalohi Channel. The lights of Honolulu are visible at night from the west end of Molokaʻi, while nearby Lānaʻi and
    Maui are clearly visible from anywhere along the south shore of the island. The shape of Molokai Island can be
    recalled as that of a shoe or a fish.
    
    Molokaʻi is distinguished in the Roman Catholic religion as the longtime residence of Father Damien de Veuster, a
    Belgian priest and Mother Marianne Cope of the Sisters of St. Francis, both of whom have been canonized Roman
    Catholic Saints for their treatment and care given during the 19th century to long term sufferers of Hansen's
    Disease, also known as leprosy.

    Lānaʻi (/ləˈnaɪ/; Hawaiian: [laːˈnɐʔi] or [naːˈnɐʔi]) is the sixth-largest of the Hawaiian Islands and the smallest
    publicly accessible inhabited island in the chain.[2] It is also known as Pineapple Island because of its past as an
    island-wide pineapple plantation. The island's only settlement of note is the small town of Lānaʻi City.
    
    Lānaʻi is somewhat comma-shaped with a width of 18 miles (29 km) in the longest direction. The land area is 140.5
    square miles (364 km2), making it the 42nd largest island in the United States.[3] It is separated from the island
    of Molokaʻi by the Kalohi Channel to the north, and from Maui by the ʻAuʻau Channel to the east. The United States
    Census Bureau defines Lānaʻi as Census Tract 316 of Maui County. Its total population shrank from 3,193 as of the
    2000 census[4] to 3,102 as of 2010.[5] Many of the island's landmarks are accessible only by dirt roads that require
    a four-wheel drive vehicle.[citation needed]
    
    There is one school, Lanai High and Elementary School, serving the entire island from kindergarten through 12th
    grade. There are no traffic lights on the island.
